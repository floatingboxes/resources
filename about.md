I'm [Dan Sweeney](http://floatingboxes.com). I used to keep lists of useful links in [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), but I've always been told it's nice to share. So here you go. 

Oh, before you go! You can [contribute if you'd like](https://github.com/floatingboxes/resources). [Submit an issue](https://github.com/floatingboxes/resources/issues) if you're not down with Git, or [fork](https://github.com/floatingboxes/resources) and make a pull request.

This site is a work in progress. It uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), EqualHeights plugin, [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and a little bit of my own know-how.

I get most of these links from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/floatingboxes), [Sidebar](http://sidebar.io/), [Responsive Design Weekly](http://responsivedesignweekly.com/), [CSS Weekly](http://css-weekly.com/), [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/), and [Web Tools Weekly](http://webtoolsweekly.com/).
